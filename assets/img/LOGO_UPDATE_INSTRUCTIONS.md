# DataPingo Logo Update Instructions

Please replace the current "PingFrame Logo.png" file with your new DataPingo logo image.

The new logo should be:
- Named: "DataPingo Logo.png" 
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 200px height for crisp display
- Colors: Should match the gradient from your logo (purple to teal)

Once you replace the logo file, the website will automatically use the new branding with the updated color scheme.
